 Scren reeeader report - it only reads the title of the webpage and then nothing else. It doesn't continue down through the rest of the page because there is no heading elements.
 I will add them now. I also made paragraphs and h1 h2 and h3 so it should be hella semantic. please don't look at the spacing I don't know how to fix that.
 
 Enjoy this- 
 "A screen reader is an enterprise-grade assistive-technology orchestration layer that operationalizes non-visual 
 access by continuously interrogating an application’s underlying semantic substrate (i.e., accessibility APIs, UI automation
frameworks, and the accessibility tree) and then performing a near-real-time, context-sensitive transformation of otherwise 
visually encoded interface states into a serialized stream of intelligible, navigable, and action-primed output via text-to-speech 
synthesis and/or refreshable braille translation, while simultaneously mediating focus governance, event-driven state change propagation, and 
interaction affordance disclosure so that users can execute keyboard-centric, intent-directed workflows across complex digital environments 
without reliance on pixel-level perception; in effect, it functions less as a “reader” and more as a high-fidelity, state-aware interface interpreter 
that converts roles, labels, properties, relationships, constraints, and hierarchical structure (buttons, links, headings, landmarks, form fields, validation errors, table coordinates, 
menu states, dialog modality, and dynamic content updates) into a continuously updated narrative plus a commandable abstraction layer, 
enabling rapid semantic traversal, granular control discovery, and friction-minimized task completion through advanced navigation 
primitives (element indexing, structural jumping, and modality toggling) that collapse visual scanning into deterministic information retrieval, 
thereby delivering a scalable, compliance-aligned, inclusivity-forward accessibility enablement solution that unlocks equitable participation, de-risks UX exclusion, 
and maximizes cross-functional digital reach through standardized, interoperable, and governance-compatible human–computer interaction translation."

it is now 5:40 and i am SURE that this is 10 points worthy.

        <p>
        By Evan Wild
        Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.
        So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>
        <font size="5"><h3>Types of bear</h3></font>
        <p>
        Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
        Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourange different behaviour however, as you'll find out below. The below table also gives you some useful facts about bears.
        </p>

              <td>20 to 32 years</td>
              <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
            </tr>

        </table>

        <font size="5"><h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3></font>
        <p>
        Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other natually growing ingredients. In general they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their sustenance from farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
        </p>

        <p>
        Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other urban creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from readily available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has proven scarce, urban bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans, ready meals, and microwave ovens.
        </p>
        <img src="media/urban-bear.jpg" alt="A black and white picture of a angry bear stuck in a cage">
        <p>
        Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets in McDonalds, to their own apartment.
        </p>
        <font size="5"><h3>Mating rituals</h3></font>
        <p>
        Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest of their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for example with cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD in the case of an urban bear.
        The following audio clip contains a fact file providing more details about bear mating rituals, along with samples and quotes from experts.

          <p>
          Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who has been really "in to" wildlife since childhood. He once went to Chester Zoo on holiday, but got ill after eating a doner kebab.
          He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about them, and thinks they sound cool.

                <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.</p>
