The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston area. They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The Patriots play their home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, about 22 miles southwest of Boston. As of 2024, the Patriots are the second-most valuable sports team in the world, and they have sold out every home game since 1994.

The franchise was founded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots and was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The team joined the NFL in 1970 after the AFL–NFL merger. During their early years, the Patriots played in several stadiums around Boston, including Fenway Park from 1963 to 1969. In 1971, the franchise moved to Foxborough and changed its name to the New England Patriots.

The team’s ownership also changed several times. Founding owner Billy Sullivan sold the Patriots in 1988, and the franchise was sold twice more before being purchased by Robert Kraft in 1994, who remains the current owner.

The Patriots played home games at Foxboro Stadium until 2002, when it was demolished and replaced by Gillette Stadium.

For much of their first four decades, the Patriots were generally mediocre, with a few standout moments—most notably Super Bowl appearances in the 1985 and 1996 seasons. In 2001, the team’s fortunes changed dramatically under head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady, beginning a 19-year period of dominance.

The Brady–Belichick era is widely regarded as one of the greatest dynasties in sports history. During this time, the Patriots set or tied many major NFL and Super Bowl records. They are tied for the most Super Bowl wins with six (along with the Pittsburgh Steelers). They also hold the records for the most Super Bowl appearances (12) and the most Super Bowl losses (5, tied with the Denver Broncos).

Other notable franchise records include the most wins in a 10-year span (126 from 2003 to 2012), the longest combined regular season and playoff winning streak (21 games from October 2003 to October 2004), and 19 straight winning seasons from 2001 to 2019. They also made eight straight conference championship game appearances from 2011 to 2018 and won 11 straight division titles from 2009 to 2019. The Patriots are the only team to finish a 16-game regular season undefeated (in 2007). They are also tied for the most postseason victories with 40 (along with the San Francisco 49ers) and have one of the highest postseason winning percentages at .645.
